# Physics Simulator
My goals for this repo:
- create balls, boxes, triangles, and star shapes that have physics
- create a way to give ANY shape specific hitboxes on runtime for a user
- create UI that allows a user to add shapes, pause the simulation, and much more
- learn backend/frontend progamming and other usefull concepts while making it
- have fun
